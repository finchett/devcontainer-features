# Devcontainer Features

This repository is for features I have written for vscode development containers. It currently only contains one feature.

### Features

*Influx Cli*

A feature for Microsoft development containers that installs the Influx CLI from their Github release page.
See the feature [src/influxcli/README.md](https://github.com/finchett/devcontainer-influxCLI/tree/main/src/influxcli#readme) for an example of how to reference it.
